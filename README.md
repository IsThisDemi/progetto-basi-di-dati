# Svelasca - Progetto basi di dati

## Intro

- Svelasca is a project for the **_Basi di dati_** course directed by prof. Pietro Sala, completed during the academic year 2022/2023, Informatica, UniPD.
- **Result**: 29/30

## What's Svelasca?

**_Svelasca_** is an immaginary platform that allow users to buy luxury products made by external companies.

The database has been created and managed **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** and **[pdAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)**

Next I have created a simple [C++ executable](/progetto-basi-di-dati/codice.exe) for the visualization and execution of queries, the program can be compiled and executed using the following example code:

`g++ -I"G:\Users\ricky\Desktop\UniversitÃ \P-2-Basi di dati\2023\Il_mio_progetto\dependencies\include" -L"G:\Users\ricky\Desktop\UniversitÃ \P-2-Basi_di_dati\2023\Il_mio_progetto\dependencies\lib" Codice.cpp -lpq -o codice
`
